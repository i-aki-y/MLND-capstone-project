## Setup development environment

In this project assumes that the anaconda environment with python2 is already setup[^1].

### Install basic libraries
```
conda create -n my_env numpy scipy pandas jupyter matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn cython statsmodels
source activate my_env
```

### Install tensorflow[^2]
The following command install GPU version.
```
pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
```

### Install Keras[^3]
```
pip install keras pydot h5py
```
### Install XGBoost[^4]
```
pip install xgboost
```

### Install prophet[^5]
```
pip install fbprophet
```
